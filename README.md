# HelpDesk-Home-Lab-Projects

## Overview

Welcome to my Home Lab Series! In this series, I demonstrate how to use Active Directory from both a helpdesk and system adminstrator perspective within a virtualized lab environment. These labs document a series of hands-on experiments focused on building, configuring, and troubleshooting Active Directory setups in a simulated IT setting.

Using VirtualBox as the hypervisor, Iâ€™ve created these three virtual machines and placed them on the same virtual network so that they can communicate:

1. **Windows Server 2022**: Serves as the domain controller and the system administrator's primary workstation.
2. **Windows 10 (Helpdesk)**: Represents a helpdesk environment equipped with tools like RSAT for Active Directory management.
3. **Windows 10 (Local User)**: Simulates a user in an organization for testing purposes such as password resets and troubleshooting.

- Showcase my expertise in Server Adminstration as well as Configuration and Management of roles such as Active Directory.
- Demonstrate proficiency in performing helpdesk-level IT tasks, including troubleshooting and problem resolution.
- Develop and document strong understanding of enterprise IT tools and workflows commonly employed in production environments.
